<br>
Good Cents is the first in a series of mobile apps by Global Causeways, a CSR consultancy based in Singapore.<br> 
<br>
In Singapore, we make our purchasing decisions based on brand loyalty, price, taste, aesthetics, and other factors. Good Cents brings a new and novel dimension to the equation: Ethics. Good Cents will tell you who’s doing what in the world of Philanthropy, so you can incentivize and reward companies that support causes you believe in.<br> 
<br>
This app is the result of years of planning and research. We’ve done all the leg work to bring the information to your fingertips. So use this app now. It’s free to download, and with a little bit of effort, or a little bit of money, can be fully unlocked.<br>
<br>
Put your cents to good use <br>
